These are log results from a hyperparameter scan.
The scan files have names like Output_{hl}_{ne}_{lr}_{dp}_{ws}_log.txt
These are the values of each parameter:

    [Hidden Layers] - hl=(3 4 5 6 7)
    [Neurons per Hidden Layer] - ne=(64 128 256 512 1024)
    [Learning Rate] - lr=(0.0001 0.0005 0.001)
    [Dropout Probability] - dp=(0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5)
    [Window Size] - ws=(11 21 31 41 51)

Each log file will end with lines like this:

    Finished Training
    Performing Analysis
    test loss: (C) 0.5127; test accuracy: (C) 0.7974

The "main" hyperparameter point we use is Output_4_256_0.001_0.5_51.
We need to know what happens to loss and accuracy when we alter one hyperparameter at a time.
So for example, make a plot of {hl} on the x-axis, and plot loss and accuracy for Output_{hl}_256_0.001_0.5_51.

Also make a 2D plot (grid?) with each pair of two hyperparameters.
E.g. have {hl} on the x-axis, {ne} on the y-axis, and make plots of Output_{hl}_{ne}_0.001_0.5_51.

I have a scrap of code in Hyperparameter.py, but I don't know if it's actually useful.
You should end up with 15 plots.
